# Pelican setup to deploy course webpage.

The public webpage for the python_course_material is deployed at:

http://schryer.github.io/python_course_material/

## Building and deployment.

The build process is automated with the use of one single
command:

```shell
make github
```

This command calls a [Python] script that reads all `Markdown` files
in `stubs/` and `stubs/pages/` and creates analogous files within
`content/` and `content/pages/` with the contents of
`external_links.md` appended to each. This command is provided as:

```shell
python add_links.py
```

To avoid confusing these generated files with user generated files,
the extension `.md` has been replaced with `_GENERATED_by_add_links.md`.

The other commands within `make github` call the `Pelican` build
itself which places its output in `output/` and then pushes the
contents of `output/` to [GitHub].

## Cleaning temporary files.

It is not a problem if the entire contents of `output/` are wiped out
by accident because they are generated, however, I still changed the
default behavior of `make clean` to clean out only files generated by
`add_links.py`. This can also accomplished using the `add_links.py`
script:

```shell
python add_links.py --clean
```
