Summary: Overview of the course

This course will be run from September 2nd, 2014 and is now accepting students.
Please contact <schryer@ut.ee> for more details.

## Course material

All course material is available at the
[repository website](https://github.com/schryer/python_course_material)
hosted at [GitHub].

## Motivation for the course

The rapid changes we are witnessing with the internet revolution have
also changed the way scientists and engineers must perform their work.
Increasingly, the analysis of data requires basic programming skills;
skills that are too often self taught using inappropriate tools.

This course provides students with hands on instruction on the use of
tools that are widely used by both scientists and leading technology
companies, yet is designed to be accessible for people with no
programming experience.

Educational experts have studied why learning how to program is often
prohibitively difficult. The best results have been obtained in
learning environments where student misconceptions are addressed
rapidly.  A number of techniques have been shown to work, but they
work best when the students understand their purpose. For this reason,
the first topic of the course introduces the teaching methods and
approach that will be used.

The course will be run in a series of 16 hands-on three hour segments.
The first is an introduction to the course structure and installation
of the required software. Note that all students will be required to
bring a portable computer to all sessions.

## Software Installation

Ideally, all students would come to the first lecture with a desire to
install [Linux] and relevant [Python] packages alongside their current
operating system.  However, if one is not familiar with either of these
it is recommended that students install [Anaconda] to acquire [Python]
and associated computational tools. Please use [Python] version 3 because
this is what we will be using. Instructors are available to aid in the
installation process, however, it is recommended that students find help
from a peer before arriving at the first half-day session.

## Course content

The next three hour segment begins introducing the [Python]
programming language using [IPython notebook]. Remaining segments will
continue with core programming concepts, and continue on to introduce
plotting with [matplotlib], and components of both [NumPy] and [SciPy]
while solving computational biology problems.

At the start of the second half of the course, students will be
introduced to [Linux], [version control], and the [Bash] shell which
are all essential tools for effective scientific programming. At this
point students will begin to use an effective text editor such as [emacs]
customized with [emacs-for-python] to edit their code with.
