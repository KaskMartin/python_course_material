Summary: Overview of the scientific Python course

Currently, this course is accepting students. Please contact
<schryer@ut.ee> for more details.

## Motivation for the course

The rapid changes we are witnessing with the internet revolution have
also changed the way scientists and engineers must perform their work.
Increasingly, the analysis of data requires basic programming skills;
skills that are too often self taught using inappropriate tools.

This course provides students with hands on instruction on the use of
tools that are widely used by both scientists and leading technology
companies, yet is designed to be accessible for people with no
programming experience.

Educational experts have studied why learning how to program is often
prohibitively difficult. The best results have been obtained in
learning environments where student misconceptions are addressed
rapidly.  A number of techniques have been shown to work, but they
work best when the students understand their purpose. For this reason,
the first topic of the course introduces the teaching methods and
approach that will be used.

The course will be run in a series of hands-on half day segments.  The
first is an introduction to the course structure and installation of
the required software. Note that all students will be required to
bring a portable computer to all sessions.

## Software Installation

Ideally, all students would come to the first lecture with a desire to
install [Linux] and relevant [Python] packages alongside their current
operating system.  However, if one is not familiar with either of these
it is recommended that students install [Anaconda] to acquire [Python]
and associated computational tools. Please use [Python] version 3 because
this is what we will be using. Instructors are available to aid in the
installation process, however, it is recommended that students find help
from a peer before arriving at the first half-day session.

## Course content

The next half-day segment introduces the [Python] programming language
using [IPython notebook]. Remaining segments will introduce plotting
with [matplotlib], and basic components of both [NumPy] and [SciPy]
while solving computational biology problems.

The last part of the course will introduce [Linux], [version control],
and the [Bash] shell which are all essential tools for effective
scientific programming.
